But neither the revisions nor the refund would be available after 20 days.</li>
					    <li>If the customer isn't satisfied after the updates, then our QA office will dissect the paper. And we will recognize the legitimate sum to refund. Assuming the paper is submitted, then the refund would not be appropriate.</li>
					    <li>In the orders where the customer is being given the drafts, it is their obligation to really look at the quality and inform us right then and there. The refunds will be made. Notwithstanding, assuming that the issues are not informed since the start and are being utilized eventually for a refund, then there will be no refund.</li>
